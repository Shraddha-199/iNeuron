    "    Better Performance –\n",
    "    The procedure calls are quick and efficient as stored procedures are compiled once and stored in executable form.Hence the response is quick. The executable code is automatically cached, hence lowers the memory requirements.\n",
    "    Higher Productivity –\n",
    "    Since the same piece of code is used again and again so, it results in higher productivity.\n",
    "    Ease of Use –\n",
    "    To create a stored procedure, one can use any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then, they can be deployed on any tier of network architecture.\n",

    "    Stored procedures increase scalability by isolating application processing on the server.\n",
    "    Maintainability –\n",
    "    Maintaining a procedure on a server is much easier then maintaining copies on various client machines, this is because scripts are in one location.\n",
