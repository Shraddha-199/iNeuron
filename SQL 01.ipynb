    "A transaction must be an atomic unit of work, which means that all the modified data are performed or none of them will be. The transaction should be completely executed or fails completely, if one part of the transaction fails, all the transaction will fail. This provides reliability because if there is a failure in the middle of a transaction, none of the changes in that transaction will be committed.\n",
